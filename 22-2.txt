input list:[4,8,7,7,4,2,3,1]
break it in half: [4,8,7,7] [4,2,3,1]
use merge_sort recursively to sort the two halves

    input list: [4,8,7,7]
    break it in half: [4,8] [7,7]
    use merge_sort recursively to sort the two halves

        input list: [4,8]]
        break it in half: [4] [8]
        the two halves have only one element each, so they are already sorted
        so we can merge them to get [4,8]]

        input list: [7,7]
        break it in half: [7] [7]
        the two halves have only one element each, so they are already sorted
        so we can merge them to get [7,7]

    now we have two sorted lists [4,8] and [7,7]
    so we can merge them to get [4,7,7,8]

    input list: [4,2,3,1]
    break it in half: [4,2] [3,1]
    use merge_sort recursively to sort the two halves

        input list: [4,2]
        break it in half: [4] [2]
        the two halves have only one element each, so they are already sorted
        so we can merge them to get [2,4]

        input list: [3,1]
        break it in half: [3] [1]
        the two halves have only one element each, so they are already sorted
        so we can merge them to get [1,3]

    now we have two sorted lists [2,4] and [1,3]
    so we can merge them to get [1,2,3,4]

now we have two sorted lists [4,7,7,8] and [1,2,3,4]
so we can merge them to get [1,2,3,4,4,7,7,8]
